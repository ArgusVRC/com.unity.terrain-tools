# Terrain Tools (edited to be compatible with VRCSDK)

This is a version of the Terrain Tools package that resolves a simple issue caused by both this package and one of the VRCSDK dependencies containing definitions for exceptions with the same name. To fix this issue only one line was changed. To install, simply copy the git link for this package and use the Install from Git option in the package manager.

The Terrain Tools package helps improve the workflow for creating Terrain in Unity. It includes a number of brand new sculpting Brushes, and a collection of terrain tools in a new Terrain Toolbox to help automate terrain workflows.
